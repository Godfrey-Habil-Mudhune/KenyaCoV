# KenyaCoV

Julia 1.3 code for simulating SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Kenya.

The main model is based on the wider population groupings of *Wesolowski et al. (2012)*, with explicit age structure. Within population group age mixing is given by the Prem et al estimate for Kenya. A pre-print giving modelling forecasts for Kenya, and describing the underlying mathematical structure of KenyaCoV can now be found on Medrxiv (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059865v1).

*src/run_KenyaCoV_agestructuredmodel.jl* demonstrates basic methods for running KenyaCoV simulations. There will be more detailed notebook examples to follow.
